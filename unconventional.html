      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">The children stumbled towards the stone building in the distance, guards escorting them through the winding mountainous trails in the bleak darkness of midnight. Naive and far from their families, they cried and wailed, creating bitter intermissions of sound echoing through the night. Suddenly, a young boy two-thirds of the way down the line faltered and fell off the jagged path into the brush and greenery of a ledge several feet below. Ignorant of the casualty, the guards continued to move the children, barely able to walk, towards the dimly lit compound up ahead.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Bruised and dirty, Willie crawled out of the mess of plants he had fallen into. Moving towards the edge, he suddenly tumbled down a steep path to the foot of the mountain. Shaking himself off, he walked and crawled unsteadily in the direction he guessed home was. He reached his house at the first light of day to find his parents still sleeping soundly, ignorant of the fact that their beloved son had never reached his intended destination.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;position: relative; top:75px">* * *</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie Robinson was simply unintelligent. While the rest of the kindergarteners were writing research papers about the Lusztig-Vogan Bijection in the Case of the Trivial Representation, he was struggling to learn about addition and subtraction. During language arts and social studies classes, his peers gave presentations on the intricacies of various anthropological topics while he tried desperately to learn the alphabet. Willie searched vigorously for the space bar of his school laptop during his class&rsquo;s sessions in the computer lab as his friends wrote advanced software programs and built computer hardware systems. Willie had no understanding of why he was so academically incompetent compared to his peers. What did they all have that he did not?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">As he grew older, Willie fell extraordinarily behind in every subject but science. Surprisingly skilled at genetics and biology, he spent his free time analyzing tissue samples through DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis or running chemistry procedures in his laboratory in the attic. Biology class was the best part of his school day, the only forty-seven minutes where his constantly whirring thirteen-year-old mind could relax and lose itself in the engaging procedures, ignorant of all of Willie&rsquo;s intellectual deviations.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">The hummingbirds were startlingly quiet as Willie stepped out of the school&rsquo;s science lab into the courtyard for lunch on a cloudy August afternoon. Sitting on the edge of the fountain, he began to untidily scrawl notes about the day&rsquo;s procedures in his science pad when suddenly, he was unable to breathe and found himself enveloped in ice-cold water. His science notebook splashed into the pool and sank to the bottom, a year&rsquo;s collection of notes and lab reports washed away. Willie&rsquo;s face grew a deep shade of red as he clambered out of the pool and, dripping wet, watched as two tall boys blundered away, laughing and shouting, &ldquo;I guess we were wrong when we thought Willie&rsquo;s stronger than he is smart.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px"><em>Bullies</em>, Willie thought while he gathered his textbooks scattered across the pavement, <em>always the same clich&eacute; action. Punch and run away &ndash; why, get some new material in life. Find some variation.</em></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">As he walked the two long miles to his house, Willie continued to ponder over his differences from the rest of his peers, taking ephemeral breaks to wring his soaked apparel. <em>Differences in intellectual capacities would mean different brain tissue densities</em>, <em>likely in the glutamate signaling pathway</em>, Willie suddenly thought, <em>and if I compared my the density of neuronal cells excited in a given time period in my brain with those of the others in my grade through neuroimaging techniques,</em> &ldquo;I would figure out what makes me different!&rdquo; Willie&rsquo;s conjectures burst into words as he began to sprint ecstatically towards his lab at home, already planning the procedures he would execute the next day.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Keith, Keith!&rdquo; A small, lanky boy with scraggly brown hair turned and a wide grin spread across his face as Willie ran towards him, shouting his name.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Hi Willie, how&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Great. Listen, Keith, I need you to do me a favor.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Okay&mdash;during lunch, I need you to sneak into the genetics classroom and steal three of Professor Carrie&rsquo;s robotic nanocatheter-included cerebral injection tubes.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Steal? Three? Willie, I&rsquo;m not sure about this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Calm down, Keith. We&rsquo;ll return them afterwards. Just do what I say, please, and meet me at my place right after school. Oh, and bring one of your friends too. I need to run some tests on you guys.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Wait&mdash;what?&rdquo; Willie gestured goodbye and hurried to his next class, leaving his only friend in the school dumbfounded in the hallway. Keith had befriended him even with the knowledge that he was the only one in the school so academically inept; Willie could definitely count on him.</p>
     
     <br> <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Keith sat on the velvet couch in Willie&rsquo;s attic laboratory along with Corduroy, a constantly nervous boy even smaller than Keith, as Willie paced in front of them, giving a speech about the procedures he was about to conduct.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie smiled. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be nervous; all I will do is inject a robotic nanocatheter-included cerebral injection tube into your arms, filled with harmless contrast material to be deployed by the drone at a particular encoded time, so that later I can use microdialysis techniques in order to analyze the concentrations of glutamate in your neural pathways . I will be doing the same procedure upon myself as well.&rdquo; Corduroy&rsquo;s eyes widened, focusing on the sharp needle attached to the injection tube. After injecting the contents of a tube into his own arm, Willie carefully carried out the procedures on a nervous Keith and a whimpering Corduroy.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; position: relative; top:75px">* * *</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie slowly analyzed the microdialysis results of the past few days&rsquo; procedures, understanding that the papers in his hands held the key to his difference from the rest of his society. Reading every single line of the report generated by the Radiological Specialty X-Bot in his school&rsquo;s science lab and scrutinizing the actual images, Willie found that the glutamate signaling pathways in Keith&rsquo;s and Corduroy&rsquo;s brains were exactly the same, which made sense&mdash;it conformed to everything he had learned in his genetics classes, all the extensive lectures about how everyone&rsquo;s DNA structure and traits were exactly the same. What worried Willie was the fact that his own DNA was different from the DNAs of his two peers; there was a lower level of glutamate in his brain, resulting in lessened intellectual and learning ability. Willie set the papers down, perplexed. What had happened to him? What had relieved him exclusively from the principles of genetics? What made him alone intellectually different from everyone else?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie&rsquo;s mind flashed back to the midnight where he was separated from the rest of the children during a trek up the nearby mountain. What had happened to the rest of the children that night? Willie violently stood up, his chair toppling onto its back, and grabbed a raincoat and a camera. Pushing the camera into the pockets of his pants and nearly tearing a seam in the process, he stuffed himself into the raincoat and ran outside, grabbing his boots and pulling them on along the way.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">It was an hour before midnight when Willie reached the foot of the mountain. The moon was a thin sliver, slightly lighting the jagged, rough path up the steep slope. Constantly slipping in the moist mud, Willie made his way up the barren hills, bounding nimbly from rock to rock, barely balancing on the wet surfaces.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Nearing the end of the trail, Willie crossed over the highest ledge to find a large, dark compound walled with grey brick and stone in the distance. He silently slipped off the pathway and approached the building through the dry grasses and scattered arrays of boulders dotting the mountainside. Upon reaching the edge of the building, Willie held his breath and stood unmoving as a guard nearby opened a door to the compound and entered, leaving just enough space for Willie to slip inside unnoticed afterwards.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">The pounding of the rain on the windows was drowned out by the creaking of machinery and the crackling of electric currents. Willie inched slowly along the wall of the brightly-lit facility, absorbed by the building&rsquo;s contents. He recognized dozens of machines being used and procedures taking place, from a multitude of DNA amplifications being held simultaneously in an enclosed lab to an operating femtoengineering tool. Abruptly, as a large truck carrying metallic hydrogen rounded the corner, Willie sprinted towards a construction isle and wedged himself between two large boxes on a bottom shelf, waiting worriedly until the truck passed out of sight.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">When Willie clambered out of his hiding place towards the other side of the shelf, he found himself in front of a large wooden door labelled &ldquo;CRISPR-Cas9.&rdquo; Inching open the door, Willie peered inside to find a large stack of papers on a desk in the center of the room. Walking to the desk, delicately picking up the first paper in the stack, and scanning through its contents, Willie&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief. The paper contained an article written by the head of the scientific facility Willie was currently in, describing the recent feats in genome editing. According to the article, CRISPR-Cas9 was the process in which a man-made cell was used to edit the DNA in the specific cells of an organism. The artificially engineered guide RNA within the cell would find a specific target sequence in the cell and cut it out, hence introducing mutation to beneficially change a specific part of the DNA.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie looked up from the article, dumbstruck. <em>This was what I missed,</em> Willie thought, <em>the genetic engineering of the glutamate signaling pathway in my brain. That&rsquo;s why everyone&rsquo;s glutamate-related DNA is the same and highly elevated, and everyone is much stronger than me academically&mdash;I escaped from this secret genetic engineering process. Everyone else&rsquo;s genomes were edited when they were children to give them greater intellectual capacities.</em></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Replacing the paper in the stack, Willie slunk into the corner of the building and inched towards the exit. He winced as the door creaked when he pushed it open, and once outside, he raced down the mountain and to his house, occasionally sliding and falling in the mud. Dirty and aching, he still sauntered confidently to his bedroom, determined to sleep on his findings and refine his perspective in the morning.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie woke in a frenzy of revelation. <em>No, it didn&rsquo;t make sense</em>, he thought. <em>If the glutamate signaling pathway was genetically engineered for everyone, then DNA being different for each person&hellip; was normal?</em> On the verge of a whole new perspective regarding genetics and DNA, Willie leaped out of bed and recorded his thoughts on a blank sheet of paper, his head hitting the desk from fatigue just after he finished his last sentence.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Keith, Keith!&rdquo; Willie raced towards his best friend, waving his science pad in the air. &ldquo;I figured it out, Keith. We did it, buddy.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Keith raced towards Willie, curiously inquiring about the results. Willie pulled the X-ray report out of his backpack and opened his science pad to the first page. &ldquo;Look, Keith. Your glutamate signaling pathway and Corduroy&rsquo;s are exactly the same.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;So? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s supposed to be true,&rdquo; Keith responded, puzzled.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing.&rdquo; Willie shuffled through the papers to find his results. &ldquo;My pathway is different&mdash;there&rsquo;s less glutamate in my brain.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;But how? How can DNA be&hellip; different?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;I thought about that too. Then I remembered&mdash;there was this one night as a toddler where I escaped from all the other youngsters climbing up the mountain. So I went up the mountain last night to see what I missed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;You went up the mountain in the night? Alone?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie shrugged his question aside. &ldquo;Not the point. Anyway&mdash;I found this enzyme called CRISPR-Cas9 that genetically engineers our brains. That&rsquo;s what happened to everyone but me, because I escaped.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Keith was bewildered. &ldquo;So that means that DNA is actually naturally distinct, and varied?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie leaped into the air. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Keith said, &ldquo;Well then, Willie, go talk to the scientists and ask them to genetically engineer your glutamate levels.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie thought for a moment. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Willie smiled to himself, a smile that had been missing in his life ever since the day he realized he was an aberration. He realized the beauty in his own brain, the beauty in his imperfection and variation. Even as a young, innocent boy, Willie was able to reach an extraordinary scientific breakthrough only with pure logic, hard work, and the simplicity necessary to question authority. Not even the engineered humans with immense IQs determined that they were a product of research, a small isolated society of unnatural citizens crafted by a greater power willing to perform scientific experiments on them. Willie turned to Keith, a sparkle that his best friend had never seen before lighting up his eyes.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole world of variation I have left to discover.&rdquo;</p>
