      <br><br><br>
      <p>At dawn&rsquo;s first light, great Beremiz Samir,
      <br>hallowed calculator, was urged by the
      <br>deathless Allah to mount his velvet sandals
      <br>and withdraw from his humble home to meet
      <br>the astonishing sight before his eyes.
      <br>Royal Prince Cluzir Shah,
      <br>his golden velvet cloak and white turban
      <br>shining brighter than the sharp scimitars
      <br>that donned the waists of his thousand servants,
      <br>stopped before great Beremiz and told him:
      <br>&ldquo;A poor wise man is he who seeks out the rich,
      <br>but a nobler rich man is he who seeks
      <br>wise men. As the foremost prince of Baghdad
      <br>I would be honored if you became the
      <br>secretary to my wealthy estate.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>After a friendly salaam and prayer,
      <br>to the prince&rsquo;s surprise Samir replied:
      <br>&ldquo;O my generous prince!
      <br>I unfortunately cannot accept
      <br>the benevolent offer you suggest.
      <br>I have been pining for the ability
      <br>to reach my beloved home in India,
      <br>and the sheik offered me a quick voyage
      <br>if I gave lessons to his daughter Telassim.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The prince merely smiled and proposed a plan:
      <br>&ldquo;I can give you faster travel if you teach me
      <br>the riddle of the rajah&rsquo;s pearls.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>With skill matching that of Allah himself,
        <br>the wise Beremiz launched out on his tail:
        <br>&ldquo;Prince Cluzir, shining among your subjects,
        <br>I would be honored to recite the tale
        <br>in exchange for a trip to India.
        <br>I must arrive home with the utmost speed
        <br>and reclaim the household waiting for me,
        <br>so I will proceed with an abridged tale&mdash;
        <br>a dying rajah left his six daughters
        <br>thirty-six pearls to be divided up
        <br>such that the eldest daughter received one
        <br>pearl and a seventh of those remaining,
        <br>the second eldest received two and a
        <br>seventh of those remaining, and so on.
        <br>Thinking that the division was unfair,
        <br>the youngest daughters called a wise old judge
        <br>who explained the ingenious clarity
        <br>of the division.</p>

      <p>The first daughter received
      <br>one plus a seventh of thirty-five, five.
      <br>The second received two plus a seventh
      <br>of twenty-eight, or four, which sums to six.
      <br>Thus the judge handed out pearls equally
      <br>until none remained and the daughters left.&rdquo;</p>


      <p>The prince promised Samir a rapid trip,
        <br>but when dawn&rsquo;s first light shone from Islam&rsquo;s skies
        <br>Samir caught sight of the ill-tempered sheik
        <br>Tara Tir among cruel assassins. <br>Angered by the noble reputation
        <br>gained by Samir along his famous quest,
        <br>the sheik was plotting a violent ambush
        <br>which led the prince to abandon Samir
        <br>from fear of his life.
        <br>After Samir&rsquo;s companion from Baghdad,
        <br>Hanak Tade Maia, caught sight of the
        <br>angered sheik Tara Tir, the great Allah
        <br>brought Captain Hassan Maurique before Samir.
        <br>Muscles rippling, the great Maurique approached Samir
        <br>and requested, &ldquo;O great work of Allah,
        <br>crafted by the Prophet, Beremiz Samir:
        <br>please gift me with the tale of the camels
        <br>and how you ended a violent quarrel.
        <br>For this I will grant you any favor
        <br>I can obtain with my two weakened hands.&rdquo;</p>
      
      
      <p>So Samir launched out on his tale with ease:
        <br>&ldquo;I am flattered by your graciousness,
        <br>royal Maurique&mdash;your words are as down deep
        <br>inside your heart as those of great Allah.
        <br>Of course I will tell you the tale of the camels.
        <br>Near the start of my India-bound journey,
        <br>I did clearly hear wild and fierce insults
        <br>erupting from the midst of an old inn.
        <br>When I asked why the men were quarrelling,
        <br>the oldest immediately explained,
        <br>&lsquo;We three received an inheritance of
        <br>thirty-five camels. A half goes to me,
        <br>a third goes to my brother Hamed and
        <br>my youngest brother Harim takes a ninth.
        <br>But these fractions yield no precise numbers,
        <br>so how will we divide up our camels?&rsquo;&rdquo;
        <br>With a plan to speed his and his friend&rsquo;s journey,
        <br>Samir offered the brothers the camel
        <br>of Hanak in order to end the quarrel.
        <br>Samir gestured to the oldest brother:
        <br>&ldquo;Now, you receive a half of thirty-six,
        <br>eighteen. Hamed receives twelve and Harim
        <br>takes four, which sums to thirty-four, leaving
        <br>two remaining and giving you each more
        <br>than you would receive with thirty-five total.
        <br>Hanak will take back his camel and the
        <br>last one I will take to speed our journey
        <br>as a present for ending your quarrel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      


      <p>Royal Maurique, head of the sultan&rsquo;s guard,
        <br>burst into applause and replied with kind words:
        <br>&ldquo;I had never thought that mathematics
        <br>was as prodigious as you described.
        <br>Let me know any favor I can grant,
        <br>and it shall be granted.&rdquo;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Beremiz
        <br>Began to respond, Hanak interjected,
        <br>&ldquo;We would be extremely grateful if you
        <br>could prevent the ambush from Tara Tir.
        <br>He harbors resentment against Samir&rsquo;s
        <br>skill, and has long been spying on us.&rdquo;
        <br>Maurique bowed before the great Beremiz&rdquo;<br /> &ldquo;I could not have imagined that a man
        <br>like Tara Tir could disturb the life of
        <br>a prized scholar like great Samir himself!
        <br>By the Prophet, I will put an end to
        <br>this matter at once.&rdquo;</p>


        <p>Thanking Maurique for his loyal service,
      <br>Hanak quickly ushered Samir away
      <br>in order to check his friend&rsquo;s fighting spirit.
      <br>Samir exclaimed, &ldquo;I formed a logical plan!&rdquo;
      <br>I can defeat the young, cowardly sheik
      <br>hiding behind the wrath of tougher men.
      <br>If I challenge him to a brief contest
      <br>testing both our geometrical skills,
      <br>I can triumph and continue the trip.&rdquo;</p>


      <p>Hanak replied in turn, &ldquo;O Beremiz,
      <br>your talents lie in calculations,
      <br>not facing a group of trained assassins.
      <br>No need to risk your young and healthy life
      <br>just to show your mathematical skills.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Soon after they departed from Maurique,
      <br>Hanak noticed wise Samir&rsquo;s wistful gaze:
      <br>&ldquo;What is this? Some longing for your country?
      <br>Or simply planning new calculations?&rdquo;</p>


      <p>&ldquo;My friend of Baghdad,&rdquo; Beremiz replied,
      <br>&ldquo;Nostalgia and calculations are not
      <br>completely unrelated. Everything
      <br>in my world is dominated by the
      <br>calculations required throughout one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>


      <p>Upon reaching the final caliph&rsquo;s home,
        <br>Samir stood gazing up at the palace,
        <br>a match for even the mansion above
        <br>where deathless Allah watches over men.
        <br>Samir was given an arduous challenge:
        <br>to receive any prize that he asked for,
        <br>he would have to compete before a crowd
        <br>with four foreign mathematicians.
        <br>After entering the holy palace
        <br>and reciting a prayer from the Koran,
        <br>Beremiz heard the caliph mutter
        <br>an insult to his skilled calculations.
        <br>Anger building up within his breast,
        <br>understanding that to reach India
        <br>and find his true love with utmost speed
        <br>he must accept the challenge and perhaps
        <br>suffer defeat before the world&rsquo;s wise men,
        <br>Samir still agreed, with Allah&rsquo;s support,
        <br>to hear the first mathematics challenge.</p>


      <p>Wise Abul Hassan Ali stepped forward:
        <br>&ldquo;Knowledge must observe the facts and then, from them,
        <br>deduce its laws. But how do we arrive
        <br>at the truth? Here is my question for you&mdash;
        <br>is it possible to arrive at a
        <br>false deduction from only truth?&rdquo;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samir
        <br>thought carefully and then explained with tact,
        <br>&ldquo;Let us suppose a mathematician
        <br>wished to find square roots of four-figure sums.
        <br>Picking two thousand twenty-five, three thousand
        <br>twenty-five, and nine thousand eighty-one,
        <br>he would find the answers of forty-five,
        <br>fifty-five and ninety-nine that all
        <br>equate to the sums of the two numbers
        <br>obtained from dividing the original
        <br>four-figure sum after the second digit.
        <br>Therefore the calculator can falsely
        <br>deduce that any square root can be found
        <br>with this method, and hence is using truth
        <br>to make an erroneous assumption.&rdquo;
        <br>Amazed at the reply, Abul Hassan
        <br>was replaced by the sage Nascif Rahal.</p>


        <p>As the scholar approached, Samir&rsquo;s thoughts whirred,
      <br>his mind blank of all but calculations.
      <br>Even amidst the risk of losing a
      <br>rapid journey to his home in India,
      <br>Samir thought calmly and rationally,
      <br>preparing himself to employ all his
      <br>accumulated mathematics skill.</p>


      <p>Yet Rahal asked a surprising question
      <br>that forced Samir to rely on quick wit:
      <br>&ldquo;Knowledge alone does not make a man
      <br>wise&mdash;imagination is required.
      <br>I would like Beremiz Samir to tell
      <br>a fable in which division of three
      <br>by three is suggested but not carried
      <br>out, and division of three by two is
      <br>carried out with a remainder of zero.&rdquo;</p>


      <p>As Samir launched out on his clever tale,
        <br>Allah increased the volume of his voice
        <br>and painted his words with a sense of awe:
        <br>&ldquo;A lion, a tiger, and a jackal
        <br>had found a sheep, a pig, and a rabbit
        <br>unaware of any predators.
        <br>The tiger suggested they divide the prey
        <br>such that the lion received the whole sheep,
        <br>the tiger received the pig and finally,
        <br>the jackal received the small rabbit.
        <br>The lion killed the tiger and asked the jackal
        <br>to divide the three different animals
        <br>more fairly among the two of them.
        <br>The jackal gave all three delicious meals
        <br>to the lion, hence dividing the prey
        <br>among the two without a remainder.
        <br>Thus dividing three by three was proposed
        <br>while three by two without a remainder
        <br>was carried out by the clever jackal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Next, the third sage Macudo asked Samir:
          <br /> &ldquo;Out of three white disks and two black disks
      <br>that are identical in all but color,
      <br>a random disk is strapped to the back
      <br>of each of three princes. The first king&rsquo;s son
      <br>can see the disks of his fellow princes
      <br>but still does not determine the answer.
      <br>The second prince views the disk of the third
      <br>but cannot calculate the right answer.
      <br>Finally the third prince correctly figures
      <br>the color of the disk upon his back.
      <br>Here is my question&mdash;how does the third prince
      <br>determine that his disk is colored white?&rdquo;</p>
      


      <p>Motivated by his desire to reach home
        <br>and find his true lover at last,
        <br>Samir responded with apparent ease:
        <br>&ldquo;The first prince erred because he was unsure,
        <br>suggesting that the next two princes&rsquo; disks
        <br>were either both white or alternating.
        <br>If both were the color white the third prince
        <br>must have been wearing black. But if one disk
        <br>was black and the other white, the third prince
        <br>must have been wearing white in order for
        <br>the second prince to still make a mistake.&rdquo;
        <br><br /> As applause was showered upon Samir,
        <br>The fourth sage Mohildin Banabixacar
        <br>whose name was known to all under the sky
        <br>gave Beremiz the ultimate puzzle:
        <br>&ldquo;A merchant obtains eight identical
        <br>pearls, with one weighing slightly less than
        <br>the others. How can he determine which
        <br>pearl is the lightest with only two weighings
        <br>and no weights?&rdquo;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wise Samir soon replied,
        <br>&ldquo;Simply divide the pearls into three groups,
        <br>where two groups contain three pearls and the third
        <br>has the remaining two. Weigh the first two groups
        <br>and if they are the same weight we know that
        <br>the lightest pearl is in the third group. Hence
        <br>we can weigh those two to find the answer.
        <br>If the first two groups weigh differently,
        <br>then weigh two pearls from the lighter group
        <br>to find the pearl that is the lightest.&rdquo;</p>



      <p>As the crowd watched foreign Samir with awe,
      <br>the mathematician began his speech,
      <br>his words crafted by great Allah himself:
      <br>&ldquo;O people of this generous caliph,
      <br>I have faced all the problems with success.
      <br>Each wise man has only trembled before
      <br>the calculations whirring in my mind.
      <br>All foes have vanquished before my prodigy.
      <br>My wisdom and soul have attained triumph&mdash;
      <br>now lord, grant the gift you promised to me.&rdquo;</p>


      <p>The caliph praised him for his flawless skill
      <br>and offered him twenty-thousand dinars
      <br>and a government career in Baghdad.
      <br>Yet Beremiz refused the great rewards,
      <br>instead asking, along with a swift trip
      <br>to India, for a surprising gift:
      <br>&ldquo;Give me the hand of the woman I love&mdash;
      <br>the shining beauty, dear young Telassim.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The caliph readily granted his wish:
      <br>&ldquo;O Beremiz Samir, your supreme skill
      <br>has struck me and Allah himself with awe.
      <br>With no doubt I will speed you on your way
      <br>with thirty-five of my finest horsemen
      <br>and the hand of your love, dear Telassim.
      <br>I and all four mathematicians here
      <br>will also shower you with lustrous gifts
      <br>to escort you under Islam&rsquo;s blue skies.&rdquo;
      <br>Samir in turn responded tactfully,
      <br>&ldquo;My dear caliph, to you I owe my life.
      <br>Thank you, great lord, for gifting me with the
      <br>opportunity to finally reach
      <br>my long-missed India.&rdquo;</p>
