     <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">The clock struck nine past noon as he trudged down the creaking steps to the villa’s basement, careful to leap over the broken ninth step, and made his way past the litter of cardboard boxes and abandoned socks to the leaking faucet in the corner. The bolts had cunningly loosened themselves and the tenth screw had jumped out again, forcing him to endure another iteration of his daily routine. </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Pulling a ragged Ziploc bag overflowing with rusty tools out of the pocket of his cargo shorts, he knelt down by the plumbing and monotonously tightened each bolt, sweat dripping down his chin. Before he could reach the tenth screw, however, he decided to examine the contents of the antiquated box once more.</p>
     <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Shaking the dust off the wooden lid and gently flipping it open, he delicately removed the photograph of his late parents and held it up with shaking fingers, breathing in its musty smell, caressing his mother’s face, ingraining his parents’ features in his mind as a feeble substitute to seeing them in real life. As his eyes scanned over the yellowed photograph, his fingers rubbing the frayed edges out of memory, he noticed a small eagle on the corner of his father’s worn jacket<span>&#8212;</span>the Nazi party insignia. Shock riddled him as he clung desperately to the fading memory of his parents as simple industrial workers and Holocaust refugees. </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">He leapt up the stairs, leaving the tenth screw untouched on the floor behind him. The faucet stopped dripping.</p>
