      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re Vice President and Harrison&rsquo;s senior advisor doesn&rsquo;t mean you know everything,&rdquo; Jacob Finstein grumbled.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Why are we having this conversation again? I thought you had finally decided to listen to your superiors&rdquo;&mdash;smirking, Levi Martin gestured to himself&mdash;&ldquo;more often.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;You do know you&rsquo;re talking to the President&rsquo;s Private Secretary, right?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t brag about being the personal aide to a man who, as we just found out, is willing to sabotage our people&rsquo;s economic security as part of a fraudulent deal with Russia. Anyway, have you contacted the tailors?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;ve made the exact clothes we asked for. Hopefully this will show the people what a selfish, corrupted upstart of a president is currently in office.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;position: relative; top:75px;">❖ &nbsp; ❖ &nbsp; ❖</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">President Richard Harrison paced back and forth within his office, his forehead knotted with worry as he recited his upcoming speech for at least the ninth time. It was imperative that he delivered it exactly as Vice President Martin had told him to if he wanted to ensure the public&rsquo;s support; after all, encouraging protective tariffs wasn&rsquo;t exactly a decision he had made with the people&rsquo;s financial interests in mind, but it was vital to the foreign policy deal he had secretly made with the leaders of Russia. Worst of all, his term ended in a few months, so if he didn&rsquo;t succeed in swaying the citizens&rsquo; favor to his cause, he might not be reelected for the 1893 presidency, and then he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to receive his share of Russia&rsquo;s trading profits&hellip;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Harrison jerked towards the door with a start, his knee jamming into the desk beside him. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Jacob. For the love of God, would you care to knock next time?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Sorry, sir. I simply wanted to notify you that your tailors wish to see you.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;My tailors, you say? Send them in.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">A minute later, two stubby men burst into the office, lopsided grins on their faces as they carried a large cloth-covered bundle between them. &ldquo;President Harrison, sir,&rdquo; the first tailor began, &ldquo;your secretary has informed us that later today, you will be giving the first speech of your new political campaign. We thought that this occasion warranted a change of apparel.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Right on cue, the second tailor ripped the cloth off the bundle, revealing a pristine white hat, a deep blue shirt, and blood red pants. Three distinct colors, stacked on top of each other. No stripes and no stars.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Still mentally reciting his speech, Harrison looked over the clothes, desperation slowly making its way onto his face. These clothes were definitely bold, to say the least&mdash;but they were simplistic yet intriguing; covering himself in the colors of the United States seemed like a good way to showcase his patriotism. It might even make the public more likely to support his decision to establish tariffs&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it!&rdquo; Harrison declared.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Just within earshot outside the door, Levi smiled and turned to Jacob. &ldquo;Harrison took the bait!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Soon, the people are going to see their president literally WEARING the Russian flag.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Three hours later, Jacob and Levi grinned as they took their seats to watch the president give his speech.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; position: relative; top:75px;">❖ &nbsp; ❖ &nbsp; ❖</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">The morning after Harrison&rsquo;s campaign, there was an air of ominous excitement. As the clouds parted before the sun to mark the beginning of dawn, all anyone could see was a moving frenzy of red, white, and blue. Men and women strolled through the streets wearing exact replicas of Harrison&rsquo;s new suit. Children weaved between their parents&rsquo; legs, carrying red, white, and blue balloons as they played hopscotch and tag. Plastered to street signs and apartment windows alike were posters of Harrison giving his speech, the words &ldquo;THE NEW VOGUE&rdquo; scrawled in black ink across the top. It was as if the country had transformed overnight&mdash;almost thoughtlessly, almost expectedly. The street signs, the restaurants, and the cities had all pledged a sort of uncontested and blind allegiance to Russia&mdash;not just with color, but with unquestioned faith in their president. All except for one wise man.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">In the heart of Washington D.C., surrounded by balloons and shops containing replicas of Harrison&rsquo;s suit, stood a small, rustic weaver&rsquo;s parlor. Its advertisements and inventory remained exactly the same as the previous day&rsquo;s, all except for one small change; on the front door was a new sign containing a caricature of President Harrison, a malicious sneer on his face as he held the Russian flag high above his head. Having seen through the lies and schemes that characterized Harrison&rsquo;s presidency, this one storeowner had taken it upon himself to inform the public of the corruption within the White House. As the days passed, more and more people flooded into the store, and fewer and fewer red, white, and blue suits left it.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; position: relative; top:75px;">❖ &nbsp; ❖ &nbsp; ❖</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Harrison sat at his desk, his eyes fastened on the pictures of screaming mobs and pervasive riots on the newspaper in his hands. He had been able to fool almost the entire nation&mdash;all except for one insignificant storeowner who toppled his rule forever.</p>
