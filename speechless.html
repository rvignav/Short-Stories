      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Your parents are computer engineers, aren’t they?&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">His crinkled brows, his lips curled up into an omniscient smirk, his fingers caressing the gray stubble on his chin to evoke a false pretense of thoughtfulness&mdash;everything about James Hawken’s face had me completely taken aback. We were only a few minutes into the first session of math camp, and Mr. Hawken was leading the class through a series of icebreakers. As part of the classic first-day “get to know you” spiel, he asked each of us to share our hobbies and interests with the rest of the class. Eager to launch into a discussion about the endless applications of computer science and my ardor for software development, I began talking&mdash;but I barely made it through a single sentence.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">His response was a blow to the chest. For the first time, I became conscious of my transition lens glasses, of the black string around my neck that represented the Hindu god of strength and knowledge, of the coconut oil in my hair&mdash;of my brown skin. Everything about me seemed to morph into the classic image of an Indian boy goaded into the discipline of computer science by his strict software engineer parents. But my parents’ occupations had no relevance to my interest in coding; I first discovered my passion for Python when my friends and I spent a weekend trying to program a robotic drone, and that fascination with the limitless applications of simple syntax eventually transformed into a zeal for artificial-intelligence-based software development&mdash;what logician Alan Turing called the creation of “thinking machines.” Ever since I built my first “unbeatable” tic-tac-toe agent, code has become a second language to me&mdash;I find solace in the precise nature of Java’s syntactic structures, comfort in the efficacy of SQL queries. The inherently artistic nature of code is what I find the most intriguing&mdash;it is the same art that enables the transition from Mandelbrot sets to fractals, that characterizes the elegant propagation of neural networks.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">I find it fascinating that neural networks capture some of the most extraordinary aspects of the human brain. Just as neural networks make assumptions about input data in order to form the foundations of their models during propagation, our brains tend to derive their own views of the unknown, an affinity that is simultaneously astonishing and harrowing. The same characteristic that allows us to unscramble jumbled words or conceptualize the jawline of a stranger wearing an N95 mask also deceives us into condoning our subconsciously formed assumptions regarding people. It was this trait that impelled Mr. Hawken to see me as yet another Indian boy interested in computer science after his parents had instilled the passion in him at a young age. And Mr. Hawken was not the first person to see me through a narrowed, distorted lens&mdash;in fact, this moment was at the latter end of a string of similar interactions, from Q&A sessions at robotics practices to trivial conversations at the doctor’s office. Every so often, I would burst into a frenzy of exasperation, trying desperately and futilely to defend my own interests to strangers who simply assumed the wrong truth. But playing the victim’s role in these scenarios helped me understand that I too had, on several occasions, conceptualized various aspects of people’s identities with no concrete information to support my theories. The tall, well-built passerby walking down the street was probably a cornerback on the local high school’s football team. A small Chinese boy wearing glasses would be excellent at arithmetic.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">Someone sitting behind me let out a squeak of muffled laughter, and my knees suddenly began to shake uncontrollably, out of both frustration and understanding, of denial and acceptance. How was I supposed to respond? I looked down at the stone floor as Mr. Hawken shifted in his chair, evidently waiting for me to confirm his biased thoughts. I had to tell him that he was right but wrong, that my parents were computer engineers but that their occupations were irrelevant to my passions, that it was unfair of him to denigrate my entire identity based on a single assumption...</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">&ldquo;Yes, they are.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; position: relative; top:75px">I sat back down, pulled a pencil out of my Jansport backpack, and doodled my speechless anger away.</p>
